# Researching Barrier Protocols

## About

This is a semi-structured repository of about one year of university work. During this time I:

 * surveyed existing protocols
 * surveyed actual implementations
 * invented new protocols
 * analysed/modelchecked/benchmarked some of them
 * surveyed the waters in which barriers live - how can barriers be built, an (in-depth-)look at MPI one-sided, etc.

## Overall structure

 * /complex-lab/ is the first ~0.5 years resulting in a small, bad report and a presentation
 * / is the last ~0.5 years resulting in my minor thesis and a presentation

## Requirements

Some things in the repository need non-standard software

 * prism mode checker - http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/
 * spin model checker - http://spinroot.com
 * GCC (GNU C Compiler), because I used local functions/lambdas in the c programming language
 * MPI (Message Passing Interface)

## Misc

 * Some things might be broken
 * Apologies for the slides being incomplete. I'm bad at git.

## Why upload this?

 * For people interested in researching barrier protocols
 * As a kind of portfolio entry so future employers can see what I did and how I did it
