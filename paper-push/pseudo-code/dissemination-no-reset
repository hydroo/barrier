variables:

  shared: barrier[threadCount] (each thread/process has its element locally)
  init: barrier[*] := 0

code per thread/process:

  for round := 0; round < ceil(log2(numThreads)); round += 1 {
    to := (threadIndex + (2^round)) % threadCount

    atomic{barrier[to] := barrier[to] + 1}

    while barrier[threadIndex] <= round {}
  }
